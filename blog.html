        <h2>1.What is the difference between "let" and "var"?</h2>
        <p>The main difference is scoping rules. Variables declared by var keyword are scoped to the immediate function
            body (hence the function scope) while let variables are scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by {
            } (hence the block scope).</p>

        <h2>2.What is the difference between arrow function and regular function in JavaScript?</h2>
        <p>Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword. However, the arrow
            functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor
            functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p>

        <h2>3.Why we use template string in javascript?</h2>
        <p>Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
            variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript.
            It allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>
